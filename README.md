# Face-Detection-System
Every day, we are increasingly dependent on technology to carry out even the most basic of our actions. Face Recognition helps us in many ways, be it sorting photos in our mobile phone gallery by recognizing pictures with their face in them or unlocking a phone with a mere glance to adding biometric information in the form of face images in the countryâ€™s unique ID database (Aadhaar) as an acceptable biometric input for verification.

Face recognition has become a critical component in numerous modern applications, ranging from security systems and surveillance to identity verification and human-computer interaction. The advent of advanced computer vision techniques and the availability of powerful libraries like OpenCV has significantly facilitated the development of robust and efficient face recognition systems. This report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of building a face recognition system using OpenCV, detailing the process from training the face recognizer to implementing real-time face detection and recognition.

It also shows the practical implementation of face recognition using OpenCV with Python. The inspiration behind this is to make an available, easy-to-use, and accurate face recognition system that can be used in various projects with an increasing need for security and personalized user experiences, this technology offers a reliable solution for identifying and verifying different people.

 The project aims to implement Facial Recognition on faces that the script can be trained for. The input is taken from a webcam and the recognized faces are displayed along with their name in real time. This project can be implemented on a larger scale to develop a biometric attendance system which can save the time-consuming process of a manual attendance system.
